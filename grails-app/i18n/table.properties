effectorTable.combined-prediction.help.header=Combined prediction
effectorTable.combined-prediction.help.text=Summary of the predicted likelihood that the gene is an effector for type 2 diabetes. This prediction takes \
  into account all of the genetic, genomic, and perturbation evidence shown in the table.
effectorTable.gene-locus.help.header=Gene and locus
effectorTable.gene-locus.help.text=This column, when collapsed, shows the name of the predicted T2D effector gene. Expand it to view an additional column \
  containing other gene name(s) prevously associated with the locus, if applicable.
effectorTable.gene.help.header=Predicted effector gene
effectorTable.gene.help.text=The name of the predicted T2D effector gene, linked to its Gene Page in the T2D Knowledge Portal.
effectorTable.locus.help.header=Previously associated loci
effectorTable.locus.help.text=The name of any locus that identified this association signal in previous work, linked to its \
  Gene Page in the T2D Knowledge Portal.
effectorTable.collapsed-combined-genetic.help.header=Combined genetic evidence
effectorTable.collapsed-combined-genetic.help.text=Genetic evidence is presented only for coding variants. 1C denotes a signal driven by a coding variant; 1X denotes a signal driven by a coding variant within a gene known \
  to confer a monogenic form of diabetes or lipodystrophy when mutated; 2C denotes a signal where a coding variant is included in a credible set. \
  Expand the column for details about the evidence.
effectorTable.expanded-combined-genetic.help.header=Combined genetic evidence
effectorTable.expanded-combined-genetic.help.text=1C denotes a signal driven by a coding variant; 1X denotes a signal driven by a coding variant within a gene known \
