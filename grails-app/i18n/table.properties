effectorTable.interface.help1=The predictions in the table below synthesize multiple kinds of biological evidence to classify genes that are most likely to have \
  direct roles in T2D risk and may represent potential drug targets. The left-most column, “Combined prediction,” contains the classification of each gene’s \
  potential to be causal based on the evidence contained in the table, as determined by Anubha Mahajan and Mark McCarthy (manuscript in preparation). \
  The classifications for potential T2D effectors are "Causal", "Strong", "Moderate", "Possible", and "Weak". Genes classified as "(T2D_related)" \
  are those that do not have T2D associations but are strongly associated with glycemic traits.
