variantTable.columnHeaders.exomeSequencing.titleQ.help.header=exome sequencing
variantTable.columnHeaders.exomeSequencing.titleQ.help.text=Exome sequencing provides a complete catalog of variants -- common, low-frequency, rare, or private to a single individual -- in all protein-coding genes and the regions immediately flanking them. Exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing are the only techniques that can identify rare variants, which (under some models) have been hypothesized to have more dramatic consequences for protein activity than common variants. However, because exome sequencing is still more expensive than SNP arrays, sample sizes for these studies are generally smaller, and variants therefore may not reach statistical significance as easily. Finally, although exome sequencing is in theory capable of identifying all variants, the reliability of coverage across any gene or region will vary, either because of the technique used or because some regions of the genome are by nature "badly behaved," or difficult to sequence properly.

variantTable.columnHeaders.exomeSequencing.pValueQ.help.header=thresholds for significance
variantTable.columnHeaders.exomeSequencing.pValueQ.help.text=Genome-wide significance is typically defined as p-value of association below 5x10^-8. If a variant reaches locus-wide (p-value below 5x10^-4) or even nominal (p-value below 0.05), it may still be associated with disease. Investigating the variant's association in studies with larger sample sizes, or considering other evidence for involvement with disease, can be informative.

variantTable.columnHeaders.exomeSequencing.oddsRatioQ.help.text=Most variants involved in complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes have small odds ratios; they influence disease risk, but not dramatically. A few variants with much larger odds ratios -- such as <a target='_blank' href=' http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7513/abs/nature13425.html'>a stop-gain variant in the gene TBC1D4</a>, found only in Greenland, with a recessive odds ratio of 10.3 -- have been identified.

variantTable.columnHeaders.exomeChip.titleQ.help.text=The exome chip was designed to identify protein-altering variants in coding regions, including non-synonymous variants, splice-altering variants, and stop-gains and stop-losses. Most of these variants are low-frequency, observed in more than .5 percent but less than 5 percent of the population. The exome chip also identifies previous GWAS hits -- variants that reached statistical significance in large studies <a href='https://www.genome.gov/26525384' target='blank'>catalogued by NHGRI</a> prior to August 2011 -- and several other classes of variants that may inform on ancestry or other traits.

variantTable.columnHeaders.diagram.titleQ.help.header=GWAS
variantTable.columnHeaders.diagram.titleQ.help.text=<a href=' http://www.nature.com/nrg/series/gwas/index.html' target='blank'>GWAS</a> use SNP arrays to scan the genome for millions of common variants -- found in more than 5 percent of the population represented in the study -- and determine whether these variants are statistically significantly more likely to appear in people with a disease or without, or in people with elevated or lowered measures of a related trait. GWAS have several limitations. They are not designed to capture information on low-frequency or rare variants. More importantly, variants identified by GWAS do not necessarily cause biological changes that influence disease risk; more often, they signal the presence of nearby variants that do cause such changes but may not be directly genotyped. A GWAS variant significantly associated with a disease or trait is therefore best thought of as a signpost for an important gene or region, rather than as causal for the disease process itself.

Genome-wide association studies typically refer to SNPs by rsID. This portal uses both rsIDs and chromosomal position to refer to SNPs; for instance, the SNP rs13266634 may also be referred to as 8:118184783 (chromosome 8, position 118184783), based on the human genome reference assembly GRCh38. Variants that do not have an rsID are referred to by chromosomal position alone on this portal.

variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.direction.help.header=Direction of effect
variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.direction.help.text=Direction of effect is shown for the effect allele. For dichotomous traits or diseases, such as T2D, \
  positive direction of effect indicates higher probability of having the trait or disease, while negative direction of effect indicates lower probability \
  of having the trait or disease. For continuous traits, such as fasting glucose levels, positive direction of effect indicates higher measured values for \
  that trait while negative direction of effect indicates lower measured values. Note that higher measured values of some traits are correlated with higher \
  disease risk, while for other traits higher measured values indicate lower disease risk.
variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.oddsRatio.help.header=Odds ratio
variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.oddsRatio.help.text=An odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 indicates a positive correlation between the effect allele and a phenotype, while an OR less than 1 \

variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.maf.help.header=Minor allele frequency
variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.maf.help.text=Minor allele frequency (MAF) represents the occurrence of the less common allele in the sampled population, expressed as a fraction of all \

variantTable.columnHeaders.shared.effect.help.text=Effect size (beta coefficient) is the estimated difference in phenotype between a heterozygous carrier of an effect allele and a \
