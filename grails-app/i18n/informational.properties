t2dgenes.mainPage.subtitle=Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples
t2dgenes.mainPage.descr=T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) \
is a large collaborative effort to find genetic variants that influence risk of type 2 diabetes.  With funding \
from <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>, the group is pursuing three projects: (1) \
  deep whole-exome sequencing in 10,000 people from five ethnicities (African-American, East Asian, South Asian, European, and Hispanic); \
  (2) deep whole-genome sequencing of 600 individuals selected from extended Mexican American pedigrees; and (3) a trans-ethnic fine-mapping \
  "mega-meta-analysis." Results from Project 1 are currently available on this portal. The T2D-GENES Consortium also funded and guided the \
  construction of the portal.

informational.policies.data_use.header=Policies and Plan for Data Submitted to the DCC and Shared on the T2D Knowledge Portal
informational.policies.data_use.section_1=The Broad Institute will serve as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for AMP-T2D. On behalf of AMP-T2D, the DCC will aggregate data, support analyses, \
   and continue to update capabilities to disseminate results relevant to the genetics of T2D (T2D) and related traits, while coordinating collaboration \
  within the AMP-T2D Project. The DCC will also be responsible for sharing the results from the data coordination and analysis activities on the AMP-T2D Knowledge Portal (T2DKP).

informational.policies.data_agg.title=Data Aggregation, Analysis, and Resource Distribution
informational.policies.data_agg.header=Data Aggregation
informational.policies.data_agg.section_1=As the DCC for the AMP-T2D Consortium, the Broad Institute (along with its AMP funded partners) intends to (a) serve as the gateway to a large (and growing) \
  aggregation of data relevant to the genetics of type 2 diabetes and its complications; (b) perform and automate analyses required to interpret those data; and \
  (c) communicate results to diverse audiences via an open access Web Portal (T2DKP), presentation and publication. Each of these goals involves distinct categories \
  of resources and activities that we will share and/or manage:

informational.policies.data_agg.section_2=We will aggregate data on behalf of AMP-T2D. Data aggregated under this effort will not be generated by the Knowledge \
  Portal development work funded through the Portal-specific grants, but rather obtained from other investigators and repositories who wish to collaborate on and \
  contribute to this effort, including other investigators funded by the wider AMP-T2D program. Moreover, the role of the Portal will not be to redistribute individual-level \
  data, but rather to generate results attained via standard and customized queries that can be widely shared with the scientific community. Because the primary, \
  individual-level data are neither generated by this project, nor redistributed to other users, the role of the Portal is limited to secure intake, storage and management, \
  automated analyses, and dissemination of results in summary (i.e., not individual-level) form while complying with intended use of the data and all relevant regulations.</p><p>We \
  will focus on three classes of data: individual-level genotypes, individual-level phenotypes, and external precomputed results \
  or annotations (e.g., results from individual studies or meta-analyses of multiple studies, processed annotations).

  informational.policies.data_agg.section_3=The data and results currently stored in the Portal, as of September 2016, have either been generated at the Broad Institute as part of IRB-approved secondary use protocols or, \
  in the case of meta-analysis results from published GWAS datasets, obtained in such a form that Broad was determined to be "not engaged in human subjects research" (per the criteria \
  described in the U.S. Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protection's <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/guidance-on-engagement-of-institutions" target="_blank">2008 Guidance on Engagement of Institutions in Human Subjects Research</a>). \
  All data have been de-identified prior to being sent to Broad; at no time or under no circumstances will investigators funded by this grant have information linking \
  data back to subject identifiers.

informational.policies.data_agg.section_4=For datasets subsequently added to the Portal, raw data will be obtained through formal NIH systems for data-sharing such as dbGaP, \
  or directly from investigators who collected the data. It will be the decision of NIH and the AMP-T2D Steering Committee whether to accept into the Portal data that are not in \
  dbGaP and, if so, the terms on which the data can be made accessible for analyses by other parties. For the raw data transferred to the DCC for representation on the Knowledge \
  Portal, in all cases, we will obtain a DTA between the Submitter and the Broad Institute (outlined below). The DTA outlinens the use and protection of the transferred data. The \
  Submitting site will be responsible for ensuring that the datasets transferred to the Broad are consented for transfer, genetic analysis, and representation on the T2D Knowledge \
  Portal. At the DCC, we will develop software for storing and managing datasets, and will not redistribute the raw data to any outside third parties. However, as part of our analysis \
  process, we may send array data to the University of Michigan (an AMP-T2D funded site) imputation server for imputation purposes only. See Appendix C of our data transfer agreement \
  for additional details. For bulk data (e.g., raw and harmonized individual-level genotype data), we will use object storage systems, with access controlled through application \
  programming interfaces (APIs). Only authenticated and authorized users can access data; all such access is logged and auditable.

informational.policies.data_agg.section_5=Additionally, we are currently building a \
  database tool that captures data use restrictions for each dataset electronically using an ontology-based consent database, and can match those restrictions against potential \
  research usage to ensure that only appropriate users can query specific datasets. Web-based tools, currently in development, support both the entry of data-use restrictions and \
  the review of access requests.  This will enable the aggregation of additional and more diverse datasets for the Portal.

informational.policies.data_transfer.section_1=For all de-identified individual-level genetic and phenotypic data generated externally (genotype, phenotypes, annotations, etc.) received by the Broad Institute \
  as DCC for the AMP-T2D Knowledge Portal, we will execute a Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) with the submitting institution. We will ensure that the usage of the \
  data is compliant with the Data Use Restrictions associated with the dataset. It will be the responsibility of the submitting institution to outline the Data Use \
  Restrictions for the data coming to the DCC for the Knowledge Portal. It will be the responsibility of the submitting site or Institution to outline the appropriate \
  Data Use Restrictions as part of the executed DTA for the DCC. Below we outline the data use and analysis plan for the DCC.

informational.policies.use_analysis.header=Data use and analysis
informational.policies.use_analysis.section_1=For all de-identified individual-level genetic and phenotypic data generated externally (genotype, phenotypes, annotations, \
  etc.) received by the Broad Institute as DCC for the AMP-T2D Knowledge Portal we will perform quality control assessment, harmonization, and association analysis for T2D \
  and related traits. This process will be a collaborative "handshake" process with the submitter. At the completion of each major phase we will share a report and results \
  with the submitter. All results will be approved by the submitting site before results are available through the T2DKP. We have outlined our procedures for the data use, \
  and analysis steps in a document entitled "AMP T2D Knowledge Portal Submitter and Analysis Guide for Data at the DCC," which may be downloaded \
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/broad-portal-resources/AMP_T2DKP_Submitter_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

informational.policies.use_analysis.section_2=We request a number of traits for association analysis at the DCC for the purposes of deposition in the AMP-T2D Knowledge \
  Portal, including: Type 2 Diabetes, Fasting Insulin, Fasting Glucose, Lipids (HDL, LDL, TG, Total Cholesterol), Blood pressure, Creatinine, BMI (height and weight), \
  waist circumference, lipid medications. We encourage submitters to share additional phenotypes, where approved by their local IRB/Ethics Committee (based on the cohort-level \
  patient consent forms), as outlined in the AMP T2D Submitter’s Guide to Sending Data to the DCC.
informational.policies.use_analysis.section_3=Assuming the submitting site has approved all these traits for analysis and display on the T2DKP, we will perform association \
  analysis in the following tiered manner:\
 <ul> \
  <li>Phase 1: T2D status, fasting glucose, fasting insulin</li>\
  <li>Phase 2: 2hr glucose, 2hr insulin, HbA1C, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR</li>\
  <li>Phase 3: BMI, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, WHR, waist circumference, hip circumference, height</li>\
  <li>Phase 4: Longitudinal and Complications data: specifications for these trait types have yet to be defined by the AMP-T2D Phenotype Working Group</li>\
 </ul>

  partner to address any quality control matters or confounders in the data before deposition in the T2DKP. Once the results are finalized, the DCC will make the data available \
  for query via the T2DKP.
informational.policies.results_sharing.section_2=The individual-level data sent by data submitters, stored, and analyzed by the DCC will never be shared with Portal users; only \
  results will be shared. The individual-level and summary data will reside in one or several data vaults behind a secure firewall. User-activated analytical modules will be deployed \
  behind the firewall to analyze the data or query precomputed results. The Portal will provide results in response to queries for information, obtained from genetic analyses performed \
  on the data. The purpose of the AMP-T2D web Portal will be to enable broad access to the comprehensive results of genetic studies of type 2 diabetes, related traits, and diabetic \
  complications. To ensure that the web Portal is effective in allowing access to results and data – both within AMP-T2D and with the broader biomedical research community – we will \
  develop an interface to provide access to results in a form designed to meet user needs while maintaining the individual data privacy requirements, and will engage Portal users in \
  assessing the value of these features.
informational.policies.results_sharing.section_3=Results from studies included in the Portal will be available genome-wide (i.e., not limited to "top hits"), and results from \
  different studies and types will be integrated and presented simultaneously. In most cases the results on the T2DKP will be queryable by study. For studies representing multiple \
  cohorts with differential data sharing approvals, we will display the approved results by cohort. Where a study represents multiple ethnicities, we will also allow query of the \
  results by cohort-reported ethnicity. Metadata and other technical details (e.g., analysis parameters, explanations of terms, documentation of methods) will be available at lower \
  levels of drilldown.

informational.policies.resource_sharing.services.header=Sharing services
informational.policies.resource_sharing.groups.header=Sharing of effort between groups to maintain or extend existing software
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_1=We will share software, methods, and code developed as part of consortium efforts. Specifically, we envision three types of sharing: (a) sharing of software source code; \
(b) sharing services; and (c) sharing of effort between groups with the intention of maintaining or extending existing software.
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_2=We are producing open-source software under the terms of the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause" target="_blank">BSD 3 open-source license</a>. As such, \
  this code will be freely available for use by any other parties; the software will be supplied “AS IS” with no implied warranty or promises of support. We will maintain \
  a Github repository from which interested parties can download the source code. The code source of the AMP-T2D Portal, entitled Framework for investigating Genetic \
  Associations (FGA), is located <a href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/dig-diabetes-portal" target="_blank">here</a>.
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_3=Our software will be constructed as a distributed system in which computers communicate using standard protocols (HTTP for transport, with REST as an organizing principle and data \
payloads defined with JSON), with well-defined interfaces specific to the computational topics addressed by each computer system. These services will in principle be accessible by \
any other party willing to adopt the conventions used by our services. To the extent that data on these services may be under privacy and use restrictions, these running services will \
be designed to provide information only in forms that protect privacy and security, or in secure, encrypted mode for other parties with permission to access and receive the information.
informational.policies.resource_sharing.section_4=The Portal architecture will be designed to facilitate front-end contributions (e.g., extensions of existing widgets for data exploration) from a wide community of developers. \
Data or computations for REST servers will be encapsulated as loosely coupled "plug-in" modules that may be written in different languages (e.g., Python, JVM-based languages, \
shell scripting). This approach anticipates the contribution of computational modules from other individuals and groups, both within and outside of the AMP consortium.
informational.policies.data_release.header=Policies for Data Release, Accessing the Portal, and Terms of Conduct
informational.policies.data_release.process.header=Data processing and availability (applicable for both data coming to the DCC and to Federated nodes)

informational.policies.data_release.process.section_1=We will have a 3-stage process for data release on the Portal. The figure below outlines the stages and timelines. The stages are:
informational.policies.data_release.process.section_2=(1) Data Deposit: The DCC (and Federated nodes) will receive data from submitters on an ongoing basis. The Data deposition stage has \
  several components that must be completed for the data to be ready for release into the Portal. These are: <ol>\
  <li>Data use agreements and ethical approvals for data transfer to DCC (or the Federated nodes) and release into Portal.</li>\
  <li>Physical transfer of data and all meta-data, in required formats, into Data Intake System at the DCC (or at a Federated node).</li>\
   <li>Data storage, curation, QC, and harmonization.</li></ol>
informational.policies.data_release.process.section_3=In general, upon depositing data into the Portal, a QC filter on genotypes and phenotypes will be deployed as per standard operating \
  procedures in the field. Data will only be available after these initial filters are applied. Filters will include automated steps and final human curation, as determined by the AMP-T2D \
  investigative team.
informational.policies.data_release.process.section_4=(2) <a name="earlyaccess">Early Access Period</a>: After the Data deposition steps are complete, data will be released to the Portal. This denotes the start of \
  the Early Access Period.  This 6-month time period will be divided into 2 phases. The first 3 months will be the "Early access phase 1" window where data are available to all users. \
  At this point, project sanctioned QC and analyses have been performed, but the data are NOT considered final or fully integrated on the Portal. The goal of the "Early access phase 1" time period \
  is to allow users to review the data, to perform additional QC and analyses (ideally in a "crowd-sourced" manner), and to finalize and integrate the dataset. At the end of the first 3 months, \
  the data will move to the "Early access phase 2" state, where data are considered final and fully integrated.
informational.policies.data_release.process.section_5=During this 6-month period, all analyses, results, and publications proposed are subject to the \
  "<a href="https://www.genome.gov/pages/research/wellcomereport0303.pdf" target="_blank">Fort Lauderdale Principles</a>" articulated \
  for the sharing of genomic data. Users must not submit a manuscript concerning newly deposited data for publication until both phase 1 and phase 2 of the Early Access Period have ended.

informational.policies.data_release.process.section_6=(3) Open Access Period: After 6 months, the Early Access Period ends, and there is Open Access to the finalized and fully integrated datasets. \
  The results from analyses on the data are now freely available for use in publications, based on the terms of User Responsibilities and Citing Guidelines.

informational.t2dsection.ashkenazi.header_1=T2D cases were selected from two separate DNA collections
informational.overview.project_1=<h3>Deep whole-exome sequencing in 10,000 people from five ethnicities</h3>\
<p>\
Project 1’s goal is to discover how variation in the protein-coding portion of the genome contributes to type 2 diabetes risk. The project’s dataset is unusually large and diverse, with exomes from 10,000 people across five ethnicities, including 1,000 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,000 controls from each:\
</p>\
<ul>\
<li>African American (samples from Wake Forest University and the Jackson Heart Study)</li>\
<li>South Asian (UK LOLIPOP; Singapore)</li>\
<li>East Asian (Korea; Singapore)</li>\
<li>Hispanic (Starr County; San Antonio)</li>\
<li>European (Finns (METSIM); Ashkenazim)</li>\
</ul>\
<p>\
This diversity of ancestries allows scientists to find new genetic variants in populations that have otherwise been understudied. The project is also examining exomes to identify the transcripts most likely to be involved in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. In addition, T2D-GENES researchers are closely examining genomic locations that have been implicated in single-gene and syndromic forms of type 2 diabetes (such as MODY), evaluating them for association with traits that are related to the disease (such as fasting glucose levels). Ultimately, Project 1 is intended to answer major questions about the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes and how natural selection has shaped it, and to spur the development of new statistical and analytical methods that can be used in genomic studies of other diseases.\
</p>
informational.overview.project_2=<h3>Deep whole-genome sequencing of 600 individuals selected from extended Mexican American pedigrees</h3>\
<p>\
Project 2 aims to identify low-frequency and rare variants (those seen in less than five and less than .05 percent of the population, respectively) influencing type 2 diabetes risk. The project's dataset includes whole-genome sequence information on 1,043 people from 20 Mexican-American extended families in which type 2 diabetes is unusually common. The research participants were selected from two studies: the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study (SAFDGS), collectively referred to as the San Antonio Mexican American Family Studies (SAMAFS). About 600 partipants have undergone high-quality whole-genome sequencing, with an average of 50x coverage. The remaining 440 participants have had genotypes imputed genome-wide based on their family members' information and data from the 1000 Genomes Project.\
</p>\
<p>\
Studies of large, complex pedigrees, such as Project 2, are especially well-suited for the study of rare variants. Finding rare variants in the population at large requires extremely large sample sizes; often, the variants may be seen only once, making it difficult to reliably determine their effects on phenotype. However, by studying large pedigrees, scientists can increase their chances of finding multiple individuals who carry the same rare variants (because those variants run in their families). Therefore, Project 2's approach provides a way to identify low-frequency and rare variants -- both at known GWAS signals and novel genomic loci -- that may contribute to type 2 diabetes risk.\
</p>
informational.overview.project_3=<h3>Trans-ethnic fine-mapping "mega-meta-analysis"</h3>\
<p>\
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated dozens of genomic regions in type 2 diabetes risk, but in many cases it is unclear which variants in those regions actually influence the underlying biology of disease, and which variants are merely near the disease-causing variants but do not themselves contribute to pathophysiology. The goal of Project 3 is to precisely identify the causal variants by (1) focusing on genomic regions previously implicated in type 2 diabetes risk; (2) inferring the existence of surrounding low-frequency variants by imputing relevant data from the 1000 Genomes Project; and (3) using a range of statistical approaches to determine which of these variants are most likely to cause disease.\
</p>\
<p>\
A "mega-meta-analysis," Project 3 involves data from 26,488 type 2 diabetes patients and 83,964 non-diabetic controls, with follow-up in 21,491 patients and 55,647 controls. The project is a collaboration between five consortia with research participants from different continental ancestry groups: AGEN-T2D (East Asians), DIAGRAM (Europeans), SAT2D (South Asians), MAT2D (Mexican Americans), and MEDIA (African Americans).\
</p>\
<p>\
This diversity of ancestries is especially important to the study design. Variants that are tightly correlated by location in some ancestry groups (e.g., Europeans) may travel more independently in other groups (e.g., African Americans). Therefore, examining data from many different groups can help distinguish between true causal variants and those that are merely along for the ride.\

  certified adjudicators at participating GRCs. Through the Center for Inherited Diseases Research (CIDR), SiGN plans to genotype 10,296 carefully phenotyped stroke cases \
  using genome-wide SNP arrays, and add to these another 4,253 previously genotyped cases for a total of 14,549 cases. To maximize power for subtype analyses, the study \
  allocates genotyping resources almost exclusively to cases. Publicly available studies provide most of the control genotypes. CIDR-generated genotypes and corresponding \

informational.about_stroke.header=About the Cerebrovascular Disease<br>Knowledge Portal project
informational.about_stroke.section_1=The Cerebrovascular Disease Knowledge Portal is being developed by a team of scientists \
  and software engineers at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a> in collaboration \
  with a team at <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/" target="_blank">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> \
  and many collaborators from across the globe, with funding \
  from the NIH and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The platform seeks to provide comprehensive \
  quality-assured genetic, phenotypic and imaging data on large numbers of patients with stroke from across the world. The \
  ultimate goal is to automate existing or newly developed best-practice statistical methods for phenotype transformation, \
  quality control, imputation, analysis of population structure, and variant or gene association to enable testing of the most \
  compelling hypotheses as rapidly as possible, translating genomic data into therapeutic insights.
informational.about_ISGC.header=International Stroke Genetic Consortium (ISGC)
informational.about_ISGC.section_1=The ISGC is an international collaboration of stroke physicians and scientists who have agreed \
  to pool resources and expertise in an effort to unravel the genetic basis of stroke. The ISGC focuses on the genetic basis of stroke, \
  seeking to use and supplement the substantial amount of human genetic data available from people who have suffered a stroke to \
  identify and validate genes that increase an individual’s risk of suffering a stroke.
informational.about_ISGC.section_2=Unraveling the genetic basis of stroke will be a first step to developing both more effective \
  treatments and allowing earlier intervention for stroke treatment as well as identifying new targets for drug treatment. After \
  identifying DNA regions that might be critical for the incidence or reoccurrence of stroke, researchers will intensively analyze \
  variations in DNA sequence in targeted populations. This research will add to the foundational understanding of stroke and promises \
  to lead to new drug targets as well as the better targeting of drugs.
informational.about_ISGC.section_3=In addition to generating data, an important goal of the ISGC is to collaborate by pooling resources \
  and expertise to better understand the many complex biological processes such as blood clotting, vessel weakening rupture, plaque \
  formation in blood vessels, and breakdown of circulating emboli, which can precipitate a stroke.
informational.about_stroke_portal.header=The Cerebrovascular Disease Knowledge Portal
informational.about_stroke_portal.section_1=Researchers are building a database of DNA sequence, functional and epigenomic information, \
  and clinical data from studies on cerebrovascular disease and its complications, and creating analytic tools to analyze these data. \

informational.about_t2d.title=About the Accelerating Medicines Partnership and the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal project
informational.about_t2D.under_title=The Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal is being developed as part of the \
  <a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp">Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP)</a>, \
  a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \
  10 biopharmaceutical companies, and multiple non-profit organizations that is managed through the <a href="http://www.fnih.org/">Foundation \
  for the NIH (FNIH)</a>. AMP seeks to harness collective capabilities, scale, and resources toward improving current efforts to develop new \
  therapies for complex, heterogeneous diseases. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients \
  while reducing the time and cost of developing them, by jointly identifying and validating promising biological targets for several diseases, \
  including type 2 diabetes.
informational.about_t2d.ampt2d.header=AMP T2D
informational.about_t2d.ampt2d_sec1=The AMP type 2 diabetes (AMP T2D) consortium is a collaboration of a number of AMP funded investigators from \
  around the world, including the Broad Institute, University of Michigan, University of Oxford, and the European Biomedical Institute.  AMP T2D \
  focuses on type 2 diabetes genetics, seeking to use and supplement the substantial amount of human genetic data available from people with type \
  2 diabetes, or at risk of developing it, to identify and validate novel molecules and pathways as targets for therapeutic development. Genetic \
  data combined with information on gene expression and epigenomics in relevant tissues, and clinical information, can provide clues about the \
  effects of genetic changes within an individual's genome that increase or decrease one's risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, \
  including heart and kidney disease.
informational.about_t2d.ampt2d_sec2=After identifying DNA regions that might be critical for the development or progression of type 2 diabetes, \
  researchers will intensively analyze variations in DNA sequence in targeted populations. Among other things, they will be looking for rare \
  individuals whose genetic inheritance may provide a model of what a targeted drug might achieve. This research will add to the foundational \
  understanding of type 2 diabetes and has the potential to lead to new drug targets and better targeting of drugs.
informational.about_t2d.ampt2d_sec3=In addition to generating data, an important goal of the AMP T2D consortium is to make these data accessible \
  via a knowledge portal, using genetic and phenotypic data generated from type 2 diabetics and controls across multiple populations in order to \
  bring forth discoveries in the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes and to facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets for treating \
  this disease.
informational.about_t2d.t2dkp.header=The T2D Knowledge Portal
informational.about_t2d.t2dkp_sec1=Researchers are building a database of DNA sequence, functional and epigenomic information, and clinical data \
  from studies on type 2 diabetes and its macro- and microvascular complications, and creating analytic tools to analyze these data. The data and \
  analytical tools are accessible to academic and industry researchers, and all interested users, to identify and validate changes in DNA that \
  influence onset of type 2 diabetes, disease severity, or disease progression.
informational.about_t2d.t2dkp_sec2=The Knowledge Portal is intended to serve three key functions:
informational.about_t2d.t2dkp_sec3=<li>To be a central repository for large datasets of human genetic information linked to type 2 diabetes and related \
  traits.</li><li>To function as a scientific discovery engine that can be harnessed by the community at large, and assist in the selection of new \
  targets for diabetic drug design.</li><li>Eventually, to facilitate the conduct of customized analyses by any interested user around the world, \
  doing so in a secure manner that provides high quality results while protecting the integrity of the data.</li>
informational.about_t2d.t2dkp_sec4=If successful, this model of making human genomic data accessible to the world might become a paradigm for other \
  diseases, as a way to catalyze scientific advances throughout all fields of human biology.
informational.about_t2d.t2dkp_sec5=The Knowledge Portal is intended to be <i>secure</i>, <i>compliant</i> with pertinent ethical regulations, \
  <i>accessible</i> to a wide user base, <i>inviting</i> to researchers who may want to contribute data and participate in analyses, <i>organic</i> \
  in the continuous incorporation of scientific advances, <i>modular</i> in its analytical capabilities and user interfaces, <i>automated</i>, \
  <i>rigorous</i> in the quality of data aggregation and returned results, <i>versatile</i>, and <i>sustainable</i>.
informational.about_t2d.history.header=History
informational.about_t2d.history_sec1=Sparked from the efforts of the T2D-GENES Consortium (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation \
  sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples; T2D-GENES) to aggregate and share results from large-scale T2D sequence and genotype datasets, the prototype \
  T2D KP was built with seed funding from the NIDDK via the T2D-GENES Consortium and the Slim Initiative for Genomic Medicine in the Americas for \
  T2D (SIGMA T2D).
informational.about_t2d.funding.header=Funding
informational.about_t2d.funding_sec1=Development of the T2D Knowledge Portal is currently supported by three grants from AMP: AMP-DCC and T2DK at \
  the Broad Institute, and AMP-EDP to the University of Michigan. The Broad Institute serves as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) of AMP T2D. On \
  behalf of AMP T2D, the DCC aggregates data, automates analysis, and communicates results relevant to the genetics of type 2 diabetes and related \
  traits, and supports collaboration within the AMP T2D Project. T2DK creates the infrastructure to support the data, instantiates automatic quality \
  control filters for data processing, and develops the analytical modules that will carry out customized analyses <i>in situ</i>. The AMP-EDP team \
  will develop additional software tools that will be integrated into the Portal to allow a wider range of supported analyses. Recently, a fourth \
  development grant was awarded to the European Biomedical Institute to build a sister infrastructure to the DCC for data aggregation and analysis, \
  in order to allow federated access via the Portal to data that may not leave Europe. AMP T2D aims to make pre-competitive data, analyses, and \
  research resources accessible and useful to the biomedical community, and to conduct studies to determine the functions of relevant variants and \
  the mechanisms by which they may contribute to disease.
informational.about_t2d.funding_sec2=The Knowledge Portal is also funded by the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/news/1405">Slim Initiative \
  for Genomic Medicine in the Americas (SIGMA)</a>, which supports research on the genetics of T2D in Hispanic populations as well as a Spanish-language \
  version of the Portal.

  is a consented, EMR-linked medical care setting biorepository of the Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC) drawing from a population of over 70,000 inpatients and 800,000 outpatient \
  visits annually. MSMC serves diverse local communities of upper Manhattan, including Central Harlem, East Harlem, and Upper East Side with broad health disparities.
informational.data.project.BioMe2=The BioMe Biobank was founded in September 2007 and as of September 2016, &gt; 34,000 participants were enrolled. IPM BioMe Biobank populations \
  include 28% African American, 38% Hispanic Latino predominantly of Caribbean origin, and 23% Caucasian/White. Enrolled participants consent to be followed throughout their clinical \
  care (past, present, and future) at Mount Sinai in real-time, integrating their genomic information with their electronic health records for discovery research and clinical care \
  implementation. The BioMe Biobank disease burden is reflective of health disparities with broad public health impact. Biobank operations are fully integrated in clinical care processes, \
  including direct recruitment from clinical sites waiting areas and phlebotomy stations by dedicated Biobank recruiters independent of clinical care providers, prior to or following a \
  clinician standard of care visit. Recruitment currently occurs at a broad spectrum of over 30 clinical care sites.
informational.data.funding.BioMe=The BioMe Biobank is supported by the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies.
informational.data.exptsumm.BioMe1=The BioMe AMP T2D GWAS sample set is comprised of 13,034 unique individuals. The major ancestry groups are admixed American (41.5%) and African American \
  (38%). Subjects of European ancestry comprise 19.8% of the set, and 0.006% are South Asian.
informational.data.exptsumm.BioMe2=Samples were genotyped on at least one of three platforms: Illumina Exome Array, which assayed nearly 200,000 autosomal variants; Illumina GWAS \
  Array, which assayed over 844,000 autosomal variants; and Affymetrix GWAS Array, which assayed over 837,000 autosomal variants.
informational.data.exptsumm.BioMe3=T2D case and control definition algorithms were developed by a multidisciplinary team of scientists, clinicians, and software specialists. \
  Comprehensive documentation of the algorithms can be found at <a href="https://www.phekb.org/phenotype/type-2-diabetes-mellitus" target="_blank">www.phekb.org/phenotype/type-2-diabetes-mellitus</a>. \
  This algorithm has been validated with excellent performance statistics; 100% sensitivity and &gt; 98% positive predictive value for cases, and &ge; 98% sensitivity and &ge; 98% positive \
  predictive value for controls.
informational.data.overview.BioMe1a=Data were analyzed by the Analysis Team at the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Data Coordinating Center (AMP-DCC), Broad Institute. After \
  sample quality control (excluding samples flagged for non-type 2 diabetes, and removing duplicates where samples had been assayed on multiple platforms), results from the two GWAS arrays were combined \
  in meta-analysis and results from the exome array were analyzed separately. A single set of p-values was produced using a MEGA analysis strategy, including all samples \
  in a single association test.
informational.data.overview.BioMe1b=T2D associations were adjusted either for age and sex, or for age, sex, and BMI. Among the top 20 variants for T2D association, \
  <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/variantInfo/variantInfo/rs7903146" target="_blank">rs7903146</a>, \
  within the well-known T2D risk gene <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/gene/geneInfo/TCF7L2" target="_blank"><i>TCF7L2</i></a>, was the only variant reaching genome-wide significance. \
  An analysis of previously known associations revealed four that were nominally significant. Additionally, about half of the previously associated variants \
  that were analyzed had odds ratios with the same direction of effect as previously published for those variants
informational.data.overview.BioMe2=Fasting glucose associations were calculated from inverse normalized age- and sex-adjusted residuals. None of the top results \
  reached genome-wide significance. Four previously identified risk variants reached nominal significance in this analysis. Overall, 80% of the previously identified variants that were \
  analyzed were shown to have the same direction of effect as the known result
informational.data.overview.BioMe3=HbA1c associations were calculated from inverse normalized age- and sex-adjusted residuals, both with and without additional adjustment for BMI. \
  The analysis of HbA1c performed similarly to fasting glucose, with no genome-wide associations in the top 20. No \
  previously identified variants reached nominal significance. In total, 62.5% of all variants that were previously identified (

   and for insulin sensitivity index (ISI), up to 4,769.
informational.data.project.CAMP=This work was performed at Pfizer Inc. and Massachusetts General Hospital as part of a public-private partnership to generate genotype data for a cardiometabolic and prediabetic cohort.
informational.data.exptsumm.CAMP=The MGH Cardiology and Metabolic Patient (CAMP MGH) cohort comprises 3,857 subjects recruited between 2008 and 2012. Approximately 86% of subjects were of European ancestry; 10% were African \
  American; 2% were admixed American; 1% were East Asian; and 1% were South Asian. Two thirds of the subjects were drawn from patients who had appointments with a physician in the MGH Heart Center, while one third were \
  recruited independent of any hospital visit. All subjects had plasma and serum samples collected, as well as blood for genomic DNA. Subjects with known diabetes had vascular reactivity measurements (FMD of brachial artery), \
  while subjects without known diabetes had an oral glucose tolerance test. Exome Core Chip genotyping was performed on all subjects.
informational.data.overview.CAMP1=Data were analyzed by the Analysis Team at the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Data Coordinating Center (AMP-DCC), Broad Institute. After removing related samples and samples flagged \
  for non-type 2 diabetes, 3,453 samples (540 T2D cases and 2,913 controls) were analyzed. Two different statistical models were applied to analyze associations of variants with type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose \
  levels, and fasting insulin levels.
informational.data.overview.CAMP2=The strongest association with T2D, at genome-wide significance, was observed for the variant rs9468919 on chromosome 6 near <i>HLA-C</i>. Detection of an association with this \
  locus was unexpected because it is known to be associated with T1D, but type 1 diabetics had been removed from the sample set before analysis. To evaluate this result further, we investigated the linkage \
  disequilibrium (LD) relationships of this SNP with others in the region. rs9468919 is not in LD with any variants known to be associated with T1D, but is in moderate LD with SNPs in the region that are reported \
  to be associated with T2D. Supporting its potential association with T2D, this SNP displays a T2D association of nominal significance (p = 0.055) in the DIAGRAM Transethnic meta-analysis dataset.
informational.data.overview.CAMP3=While we cannot fully explain this signal, it is unlikely that the result at rs9468919 is due to T1D sample contamination, known confounders, or to poor quality of the SNP genotyping. \
  In any first-pass, cohort-specific analysis such as this, some results may be inflated or even spurious due to limited sample size or cohort-specific effects. However, the high quality of the data, QC, and analysis \
  methods applied are consistent with all standards within the T2D genetics community.
informational.data.overview.CAMP4=Other than the <i>HLA-C</i> signal, additional signals of nominal significance were detected at previously reported T2D-associated loci.
informational.data.overview.CAMP5=A variant associated with fasting glucose levels at genome-wide significance was detected near <i>MTNR1B</i> on chromosome 11. Additional signals of nominal significance were detected \
  at loci previously reported to be associated with fasting glucose levels, and several rare variants with significant effects were also seen.
informational.data.overview.CAMP6=A variant associated with fasting insulin levels at genome-wide significance was detected near <i>CHMP4C</i> on chromosome 8. However, since the minor allele count for this variant \
  was only 8 in this dataset, the result could be spurious. A signal of nominal significance was detected at the <i>IGF1</i> locus, previously reported to be associated with fasting insulin levels.

informational.data.overview.17K=Samples were subdivided into 12 sub-groups according to ancestry and study of origin. Each sub-group was analyzed independently, with sub-group specific principal components \
  and genetic relatedness estimates. Association tests were performed with both a linear mixed model, as implemented in EMMAX, using covariates for sequencing batch, and the Firth test, as implemented in \
  EPACTS, using covariates for principal components and sequencing batch. Related samples were excluded from the Firth analysis but maintained in the EMMAX analysis. Variants were then filtered from each \
  sub-group analysis, according to low call rate, differential case-control missingness, or deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (as computed separately for each sub-group). Association statistics were \
  then combined via a fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, at both the level of ancestry as well as across all samples. On the Portal, results are shown for each subgroup, each ancestry, \
  and all samples. P-values are taken from the EMMAX analysis, while effect sizes are taken from the Firth analysis.

informational.data.exptsumm.BioMe2b=Phenotypes were recorded during routine medical visits, and reflect the value at the time of the most recent \
  visit at which that measurement was taken (or, where applicable, at the last non-pregnant visit at which that measurement was taken).
informational.data.exptsumm.BioMe4=In addition to T2D status, the phenotypes considered in the Phase 1  analysis were fasting glucose level, \
  measured in blood samples taken from patients who had not had food or drink for at least 8 hours, and HbA1c level, which is an indicator of \
  average blood glucose levels over a three-month period.
informational.data.exptsumm.BioMe5=The Phase 2 analysis included seven traits: serum creatinine levels (4,844 samples), diastolic blood pressure \
  (7,597 samples), systolic blood pressure (7,586 samples), LDL cholesterol levels (2,076 samples), HDL cholesterol levels (2,059 samples), body \
  mass index (7,249 samples), and estimated glomerular filtration rate, calculated using serum creatinine levels (4,844 samples).
informational.data.overview.BioMe5=Associations of serum creatinine levels were calculated by rank-based inverse normalization of age- and \
  sex-adjusted residuals. Residuals were calculated within each population. No significant associations were found.
informational.data.overview.BioMe6a=Diastolic and systolic blood pressure values were increased by 10 or 15, respectively, for individuals \
  on hypertension medications. No significant associations with either diastolic or systolic blood pressure were seen. A comparison of variant \
  associations in this study with the variants reported to be significantly associated with diastolic blood pressure by the ICBP GWAS consortium (
informational.data.overview.BioMe6b=) showed that the same direction of effect was seen for 13 of the 18 variants detected in both studies.
informational.data.overview.BioMe7a=For LDL cholesterol, the variant <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/variantInfo/variantInfo/rs7412" target="_blank">exm1479366</a> \
  (rs7412) reached genome-wide significance in the well known <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/gene/geneInfo/APOE" target="_blank"><i>APOE</i></a> \
  region on chromosome 19. In another known LDL-associated locus, <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/gene/geneInfo/CELSR2" target="_blank"><i>CELSR2</i></a>, \
  the variant <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/variantInfo/variantInfo/rs7528419" target="_blank">rs7528419</a> approached but did \
  not reach genome-wide significance. Of 41 variants analyzed both in this study and in a previous study of blood lipid associations (
informational.data.overview.BioMe7b=), 37 showed the same direction of effect in both studies.
informational.data.overview.BioMe8=For HDL cholesterol, there was a strong genome-wide significant association for \
  <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/variantInfo/variantInfo/rs183130" target="_blank">rs183130</a> on chromosome 16 in the previously \
  established <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/gene/geneInfo/CETP" target="_blank"><i>CETP</i></a> locus. rs183130 does not appear \
  to be in LD with any of the variants previously reported at <i>CETP</i>. Another established locus, <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/gene/geneInfo/LIPC" target="_blank"><i>LIPC</i></a>, \
  approaches genome-wide significance with variant <a href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/variantInfo/variantInfo/rs261332" target="_blank">rs261332</a> \
  but falls just short. Of 34 variants seen in both this study and the Willer <i>et al.</i> study (see above), 25 show the same direction of effect in both studies.
informational.data.overview.BioMe9=No significant associations were seen for either body mass index or estimated glomerular filtration rate.
