t2dgenes.mainPage.descr=T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) \
is a large collaborative effort to find genetic variants that influence risk of type 2 diabetes.  With funding \
from <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>, the group has conducted \
two sequencing studies and one GWAS-based fine-mapping study in five ethnicities(African-American, East Asian, South \
Asian, European, and Hispanic). The T2D-GENES Consortium also funded and guided the construction of this portal.

<a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>-funded \
portal contains results from genetic association studies of type 2 diabetes, \
including projects that used exome sequencing, exome arrays for low-frequency variants, and SNP arrays for \
common variants (GWAS). The portal also contains results from GWAS meta-analyses of 24 other traits. To \

aboutTheData.datasets.t2dgenes=Exome sequencing results from 10,000 people (half T2D cases, half controls) from five ethnic groups \
(African-American, East Asian, South Asian, European, and Hispanic). The results are part of a \
joint analysis of 13,000 exomes with the GoT2D consortium. T2D-GENES also funded this portal.
aboutTheData.datasets.got2d=Exome sequencing results from 3,000 people (part of a joint analysis of 13,000exomes with T2DGENES), \
and a meta-analysis of exome array results from ~35,000 T2D cases and ~51,000 controls, all of  \
European ancestry.
aboutTheData.datasets.diagram=Genome-wide association study results from 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls, all of \
European ancestry. DIAGRAM is one of the largest current GWAS datasets in T2D.
aboutTheData.datasets.gwasMetaAnalysis=Harmonized results from large genome-wide association studies of 24 \
traits, most of them cardiometabolic. Available information includes p-values, \
direction of effect, effect size, and minor allele frequency. Not all \
information is available for all traits.
