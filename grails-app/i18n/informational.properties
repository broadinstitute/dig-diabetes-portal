t2dgenes.mainPage.descr=T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) \
is a large collaborative effort to find genetic variants that influence risk of type 2 diabetes.  With funding \
from <a class="boldlink" href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NIDDK</a>, the group is pursuing three projects: (1) deep whole-exome sequencing in 10,000 people from five ethnicities (African-American, East Asian, South Asian, European, and Hispanic); (2) deep whole-genome sequencing of 600 individuals selected from extended Mexican American pedigrees; and (3) a trans-ethnic fine-mapping "mega-meta-analysis." Results from Project 1 are currently available on this portal. The T2D-GENES Consortium also funded and guided the construction of the portal.

aboutTheData.title=About the data
aboutTheData.descr=This portal contains results from genetic association studies of type 2 diabetes, \
including projects that used exome sequencing, exome arrays for low-frequency variants, and SNP arrays for \
common variants (GWAS). The portal also contains results from GWAS meta-analyses of 24 other traits. To \
learn about the datasets, choose a consortium or collection below. 
aboutTheData.datasets.t2dgenes=Exome sequencing results from ~10,000 people (half T2D cases, half controls) from five ethnic groups \
(African-American, East Asian, South Asian, European, and Hispanic). The results are part of a \
joint analysis of ~13,000 exomes with the GoT2D consortium. The analysis has not yet been published elsewhere.
aboutTheData.datasets.got2d=Exome sequencing results from ~3,000 people (part of a joint analysis of ~13,000 exomes with T2D-GENES), \

got2d.descr=The GoT2D consortium aims to understand the allelic architecture of type 2 diabetes through whole-genome sequencing, high-density SNP genotyping, and imputation. The reference panel based on this work is intended as a comprehensive inventory of low-frequency variants in Europeans, including SNPs, small insertions and deletions, and structural variants. Results from the consortium's exome chip study are currently available on this portal. Its exome sequencing data from 3,000 samples was combined with data from 10,000 T2D-GENES samples for a joint analysis that is also available on this portal. Data from GoT2D's whole genome sequencing study will be made available in the future.

got2d.exomeChipResults.descr= GoT2D led an effort to aggregate data for a meta-analysis of low-frequency variants in coding regions that influence risk of in type 2 diabetes and related traits such as LDL cholesterol levels. The study was based on data from high-density SNP genotyping with a custom array (the exome chip) in 82,000 people, of which 16,000 were funded by GoT2D. The dataset includes ~35,000 type 2 diabetes cases and ~51,000 controls, all of European ancestry.
