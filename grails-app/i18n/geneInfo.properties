gene.variantassociations.table.rowhdr.gwas.help.text=<a href=' http://www.nature.com/nrg/series/gwas/index.html' target='blank'>GWAS</a> use SNP arrays to scan the genome for millions of common variants -- found in more than 5 percent of the population represented in the study -- and determine whether these variants are statistically significantly more likely to appear in people with a disease or without, or in people with elevated or lowered measures of a related trait. GWAS have several limitations. They are not designed to capture information on low-frequency or rare variants. More importantly, variants identified by GWAS do not necessarily cause biological changes that influence disease risk; more often, they signal the presence of nearby variants that do cause such changes but may not be directly genotyped. A GWAS variant significantly associated with a disease or trait is therefore best thought of as a signpost for an important gene or region, rather than as causal for the disease process itself.

The exome chip also identifies previous GWAS hits -- variants that reached statistical significance in large studies <a href='https://www.genome.gov/26525384' target='blank'>catalogued by NHGRI</a> prior to August 2011 -- and several other classes of variants that may inform on ancestry or other traits.

Exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing are the only techniques that can identify rare variants, which (under some models) have been hypothesized to have more dramatic consequences for protein activity than common variants. However, because exome sequencing is still more expensive than SNP arrays, sample sizes for these studies are generally smaller, and variants therefore may not reach statistical significance as easily. Finally, although exome sequencing is in theory capable of identifying all variants, the reliability of coverage across any gene or region will vary, either because of the technique used or because some regions of the genome are by nature "badly behaved," or difficult to sequence properly.

  variant that is colocalized in both GWAS and eQTL studies. COLOC assumes that there is one causal variant per locus and tissue. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830394" target="_blank">Publication</a> | \

gene.firth.help.header=Firth gene associations
gene.firth.help.text=Firth gene associations are gene-level scores determined in the AMP T2D-GENES exome sequence analysis study, using a \
  variety of variant filters and two different aggregation tests. See the \

gene.skat.help.header=SKAT gene associations
gene.skat.help.text=SKAT gene associations are gene-level scores determined in the AMP T2D-GENES exome sequence analysis study, using a variety \
  of variant filters and two different aggregation tests. See the \

GenePrioritization.interface.help1=This tab displays annotations and the results of computational methods that integrate genetic association results, genetic linkage, \
  tissue-specific expression data and eQTLs, co-expression data, and other biological annotations for this genomic region. This information \
  can help researchers to decide which of the genes surrounding a genetic association signal is most likely to account for that signal, suggesting  \
  its potential involvement in a trait or disease of interest. Click this question mark&nbsp;

gene.overall.help.text=Click the question mark icons in the table to see a brief summary of each method. Columns of the table are sortable. Click the "Transpose" button to pivot the table. The Significance \
  button colors each cell based on the significance of the values it contains, from most significant (dark blue) to least significant (grey). The \
  Records button colors each cell based on the number of records it contains, with the darkest orange shade corresponding to the fewest records.
