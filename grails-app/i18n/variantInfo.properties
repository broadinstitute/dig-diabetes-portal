variant.variantAssociations.source.diagram=DIAGRAM GWAS
variant.variantAssociations.source.diagramQ.help.header=genome-wide association studies
variant.variantAssociations.source.diagramQ.help.text=GWAS use SNP arrays to scan the genome for millions of common variants -- found in more than 5 percent of the population represented in the study -- and determine whether these variants are statistically significantly more likely to appear in people with a disease or without, or in people with elevated or lowered measures of a related trait. GWAS have several limitations. They are not designed to capture information on low-frequency or rare variants, although scientists may be able to retroactively infer the presence of low-frequency variants by <a target='_blank' href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19715440'>imputing</a> data from projects such as <a target='_blank'  href='http://www.1000genomes.org/'>1000 Genomes</a>. This technique was applied to the <a target='_blank' href='http://diagram-consortium.org/index.html'>DIAGRAM type 2 diabetes GWAS</a> available via this portal. More importantly, variants identified by GWAS do not necessarily cause biological changes that influence disease risk; more often, they signal the presence of nearby variants that do cause such changes but may not be directly genotyped. A GWAS variant significantly associated with a disease or trait is therefore best thought of a signpost for an important gene or region, rather than being important to the disease process itself.
variant.variantAssociations.source.exomeChip=exome chip
variant.variantAssociations.source.exomeChipQ.help.header=exome chip
variant.variantAssociations.source.exomeChipQ.help.text=The exome chip was designed to identify protein-altering variants in coding regions, including non-synonymous variants, splice-altering variants, and stop-gains and stop-losses. Most of these variants are low-frequency, observed in more than .5 percent but less than 5 percent of the population. The exome chip also identifies previous GWAS hits -- variants that reached statistical significance in large studies <a href='https://www.genome.gov/26525384' target='blank'>catalogued by NHGRI</a> prior to August 2011 -- and several other classes of variants that may inform on ancestry or other traits.

variant.variantAssociations.source.exomeSequence=exome sequence
variant.variantAssociations.source.exomeSequenceQ.help.header=exome sequencing
variant.variantAssociations.source.exomeSequenceQ.help.text=Exome sequencing provides a complete catalog of variants -- common, low-frequency, rare, or private to a single individual -- in all protein-coding genes and the regions immediately flanking them. Exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing are the only techniques that can identify rare variants, which (under some models) have been hypothesized to have more dramatic consequences for protein activity than common variants. However, because exome sequencing is still more expensive than SNP arrays, sample sizes for these studies are generally smaller, and variants therefore may not reach statistical significance as easily. Finally, although exome sequencing is in theory capable of identifying all variants, the reliability of coverage across any gene or region will vary, either because of the technique used or because some regions of the genome are by nature "badly behaved," or difficult to sequence properly.

variant.variantAssociations.pValue.help.text=Genome-wide significance is typically defined as p-value of association below 5x10^-8. If a variant reaches locus-wide (p-value below 5x10^-4) or even nominal (p-value below 0.05), it may still be associated with disease. Investigating the variant's association in studies with larger sample sizes, or considering other evidence for involvement with disease, can be informative.

variant.variantAssociations.oddsRatio.help.text=Most variants involved in complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes have small odds ratios; they influence disease risk, but not dramatically. A few variants with much larger odds ratios -- such as <a target='_blank' href=' http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7513/abs/nature13425.html'>a stop-gain variant in the gene TBC1D4</a>, found only in Greenland, with a recessive odds ratio of 10.3 -- have been identified.

variant.impactOnProtein.variantTruncateProteinQ.help.text=Protein-truncating variants (PTVs) prematurely halt the translation of nucleic acids, resulting \
in an abnormally short protein. PTVs typically either introduce early stop codons, disrupt splice sites (thereby preventing introns from being removed from mRNA), \
or cause translational frameshifts (insertions or deletions that render mRNA unable to read codons in the \
proper sets of three).</p><p> \
Specific PTVs tend to be rare in the population at large. However, the average \
individual carries about 100 PTVs genome-wide. Some PTVs cause \
disease, others have no phenotypic effect, and still others are protective, such as PTVs \
in the gene <em>SLC30A8</em> that are associated with reduced risk of diabetes. Protective PTVs in \
humans can serve as models for drugs designed to inhibit targets.</p>
