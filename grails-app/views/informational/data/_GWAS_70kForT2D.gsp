                    <td valign="top">The T2D cases were selected from UK Caucasian subjects who form part of the Diabetes UK Warren 2 repository. In each case, the diagnosis of diabetes was based on either current prescribed treatment with sulphonylureas, biguanides, other oral agents and/or insulin or, in the case of individuals treated with diet alone, historical or contemporary laboratory evidence of hyperglycaemia (as defined by the World Health Organization). Other forms of diabetes (for example, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, mitochondrial diabetes, and T1D) were excluded by standard clinical criteria based on personal and family history. Criteria for excluding autoimmune diabetes included absence of first-degree relatives with T1D, an interval of &ge; 1 years between diagnosis and institution of regular insulin therapy and negative testing for antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD). Cases were limited to those who reported that all four grandparents had exclusively British and/or Irish origin, by both self-reported ethnicity and place of birth. All were diagnosed between age 25 and 75. Approximately 30% were explicitly recruited as part of multiplex sibships and &sim;25% were offspring in parent-offspring 'trios' or 'duos' (that is, families comprising only one parent complemented by additional sibs). The remainder were recruited as isolated cases but these cases were (compared to population-based cases) of relatively early onset and had a high proportion of T2D parents and/or siblings. Cases were ascertained across the UK but were centralized on the main collection centres (Exeter, London, Newcastle, Norwich, Oxford). Selection of the samples typed in WTCCC from the larger collections was based primarily on DNA availability and success in passing Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory (DIL)/Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) DNA quality control.</td>

                        <li>The 1958 Birth Cohort (also known as the National Child Development Study) includes all births in England, Wales and Scotland, during one week in 1958. From an original sample of over 17,000 births, survivors were followed up at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33 and 42 years (http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/studies.asp?section=000100020003). In a biomedical examination at 44-45 years (http://www.b58cgene.sgul.ac.uk/followup.php), 9,377 cohort members were visited at home providing 7,692 blood samples with consent for future Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell lines. DNA samples extracted from 1,500 cell lines of self-reported white ethnicity and representative of gender and each geographical region were selected for use as controls.</li>
                        <li>The second set of common controls was made up of 1,500 individuals selected from a sample of blood donors recruited as part of the current project. WTCCC in collaboration with the UK Blood Services (NHSBT in England, SNBTS in Scotland and WBS in Wales) set up a UK national repository of de-identified samples of DNA and viable mononuclear cells from 3,622 consenting blood donors, age range 18-69 years (ethical approval 05/Q0106/74). A set of 1,564 samples was selected from the 3622 samples recruited based on sex and geographical region (to reproduce the distribution of the samples of the 1958 Birth Cohort) for use as common controls in the WTCCC study. DNA was extracted as described elsewhere with a yield of 3054 &plusmn; 1207 &#956;g (mean &plusmn; 1 s.d.).</li>
