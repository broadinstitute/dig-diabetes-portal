    Betatrophin circulates in human plasma. It is as yet unclear whether it plays a role in human diabetes.
    A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000292971400010X">2014 exome chip study</a> examined
    fasting glucose levels in 13,754 Europeans and found no significant association between those participants’
    fasting glucose levels and the low-frequency, protein-truncating <em>C19orf80</em> variant <a
    href="http://type2diabetesgenetics.org/variant/rs145464906">rs145464906</a>
    (c.361C>T; p.Gln121*). In one cohort, plasma glucose did not differ between 23 carriers of rs145464906 (n = 23)
    and 10,620 non carriers (P=0.57); in a second cohort, 13 carriers had a mean fasting glucose of 88.2 mg/dl
    while noncarriers had mean glucose of 99.9 mg/dl (P=0.13).

    The 2014 exome chip study did find a genome-wide significant association between rs145464906 and HDL cholesterol
    in people of European ancestry (P=5.5x10-13). European carriers of the variant had 10 mg/dl higher HDL-C (p=5 × 10−11),
    lower TG (−15%; p=0.003), and nonsignificantly lower LDL-C (−5.8 mg/dl; p = 0.13) than noncarriers of the variant.
    (There were too few African-American carriers of the variant for its potential effect to be accurately estimated
    in that ancestry group.) The authors noted that another, more common coding variant in C19orf80
    (rs2278426; c.175C>T; p.Arg59Trp) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23150577">has been associated with low LDL-C and low HDL-C</a>.
    In addition, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/11/1315292110">mouse and functional studies</a>
    "have suggested that [C19orf80] may activateANGPTL3 and thereby regulate lipoprotein metabolism;”
    mice carrying a loss-of-function variant in the gene have very low triglyceride levels.
